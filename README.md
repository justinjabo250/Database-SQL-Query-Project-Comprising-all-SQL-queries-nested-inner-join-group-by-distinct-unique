My goal for the project is to analyze a database SQL query. The project will therefore cover all SQL queries, including nested, inner join, group by, distinct, unique, primary, and foreign keys, in order to produce a logical and practical result that the company will need to use it for gaining insightful information and taking and promising future decision. I will be responding to SQL Business inquiries regarding a money transfer company run by Wave as a business solution.
